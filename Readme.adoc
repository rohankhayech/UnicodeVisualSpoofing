== About
This demo program highlights how spoofed IDN's using Unicode Visual Spoofing can be distributed on a forum site. 

The master branch contains the vulnerable application, where IDN's are posted in plain-text, allowing users to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks.

The patch branch contains the patched application, which filters all URL's and converts any IDN's to punycode, meaning users can easily tell between a legitimate site and one that uses special unicode characters to appear real.

== How to Run
The program must be run on a Linux system and assumes that JDK 11.0.8 is installed.

To run the main program enter:

    make run

To run the app functionality test enter:
